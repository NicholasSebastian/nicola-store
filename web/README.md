# TO DO LIST

- Payment System: Direct Transfer or Third-Party Handler?
  - Direct Transfer:
    - When a user checks-out, a new entry in the Google Sheets is created with status 'Waiting for Payment'. (+ Telegram Message)
    - The user has to submit their 'Bukti Pembayaran' to a form in a page.
    - This 'Bukti Pembayaran' is sent to our Email and Telegram.
    - We are to manually update the row's status in the Google Sheets to 'Processing'.
    - Once the product has arrived at the customer, we manually update the status to 'Finished'.
  - Third-Party Handler: Integrate their API as a checkout option.

- Account's past orders page.

- Use bcrypt to encrypt passwords.

## Smaller Stuff

- Component content from Sanity: Header categories(, newest collection) and Footer pages.

## Even Smaller, Less Important Stuff
